Director Spotlight README

To run the project, please install the node modules since they were deleted for a lighter file size. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder, then install the necessary node modules with these commands:

cd director-spotlight
npm install
npm run dev

This project is for a school assignment to build a React application with multiple components. The data is stored in a JSON file, and Iâ€™ve included framer-motion for the hover scale effect and Ion Icons for the heart icon. Users can favorite or unfavorite movies.

Enjoy!
